title: 52 Albums in 2023
---

I have, over the last 10 or so years become increasingly obsessed with podcasts. 

But this has come at the cost of the amount of music that I listen to. Before I discovered podcasts I was music obsessed, I owned hundred of CDs, but slowly the time spent listening shifted from music to podcasts.

I'd like to change that, and as I've neglected music for so long I felt a bit out of touch, so I asked people for reccomendations. There's a list of 52 albums that I'll be making my way through, 1 a week for every week in 2023. Some of them are familiar to me, some of them I've never heard, or heard of, before. 

The list of 52 has been shuffled and I'll grab a new one each Sunday, and spend time all that week listening to the album.

I'm excited to fall back in love with music after neglecting it for so long, and In the process pick up a load of new music to enjoy.

I'll be adding the albums to a playlist as the year goes on, you can listen to them here: [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/52-albums-in-2023/pl.u-PRM6tLGZb69) [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6B159AmdyVkoy1j8H66c2X?si=60a6fd66f2994584)
