Although I think we can all agree 2020 has been a bit of a write off, there are some cool things that have come out of it, here's 5 things that came out of 2020 that have put a smile on my face. 

## The Mandalorian 
2020 has been so long that Disney have put out 2 seasons of the Mandalorian already, and the Star Wars nerd in me loved every second of it. No spoilers but I do think that season 2 was packed with fan service, and I can't wait for more Star Wars Tv shows from Disney.

## Run The Jewels 4
Killer Mike and El-P's 4th album just confirms what I already knew, RTJ can do no wrong.

## Da√∞i Frey
I enjoy Eurovision, it always churns up some weird and wonderful artists. This year though, we got what might be the catchiest song ever written. And in true scandi songwriter fashion, the words don't _quite_ make perfect sense.

## Donald Trump's time as President of the USA is almost done
Like a lot of people I was resigned to 4 more years of the most inscrutable politician of all time, hopefully after January we'll hear a bit less of him.	

## My Appreciation for Friends 
No, not the 90's TV show but, this might seem a little wishy washy but I think that 2020 made me more thankful for the friends that I have. Talking to friends has been much more intentional in 2020 as I see so few people in person now. Friends that live in other countries suddenly don't feel quite as far away when I speak to them more than people that I live in the same city as. 
There's a lot of people that I wish I had got to spend more time with in 2020 and a lot of people I can't wait to give a big hug in 2021 (if that's allowed at the time).



A year ago signing off anything with "Stay safe" would have seemed a bit ominious. Now it feels normal. 


Stay safe.
