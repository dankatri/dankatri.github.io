[Paprika 3](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/paprika-recipe-manager-3/id1303222868) - not an app that I'd thought I needed until I started cooking a lot more last year. Paprika lets you easily download recipes from anywhere and save it in a format that makes it really easy to reference. It removes the pain of having to read all about the authors story about how they found their favourite pasta shape, and lets you just extract the good bits. I've enjoyed using it and it's where I save anything that I plan on cooking more than once. 

[WorkOutdoors](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/workoutdoors/id1241909999) - More than any other app I've come across, WorkOutdoors turns your Apple Watch into a fully fledged workout computer. Its a mega customisable app that I've been using for running. You can tweak the display to show exactly what you want to see, and even download maps onto the watch in case you get lost when you're out on a run.  I've barely scratched the surface of what can be done with WorkOutDoors, but it's well worth the Â£6. 

[WaterMinder](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/waterminder/id653031147) - I've been trying to drink more water, it helps to be nagged and WaterMinder does that as well as provide a nice widget that acts as a handy reminder.
