I've accumulated a lot of random things over the years to do with travel, and making it easier. When I was younger I spent 3 to 4 weekends a month travelling and seeing friends. It taught me a lot about travel that applies to both long and short trips. 

One important thing I learned is that you really want to keep dirty clothes away from clean ones. It sounds obvious, but when you're living out of a backpack for a weekend it's too easy to just have everything thrown in. This is where I discovered the magic that is packing cubes.

Packing cubes make it really easy to organise your stuff inside a bag, which makes it easier to find things. It also makes it easier to empty a bag so you can use it as a bag to walk around with when you get to your destination.

The laundry stuff sack takes that idea a bit further. It's a tube that has has a movable wall in the middle, so you end up with 2 compartments that share space, as one empties, the other gains space. So as you use clothes they take up more and more room in the dirty side of the sack. 

It's such an incredibly simple idea that as soon as I saw it I was surprised I'd never seen anything similar before.

Now the Laundry stuff sack is an essential item for me on any trip. It's simple and does it's job very well.
