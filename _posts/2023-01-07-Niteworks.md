Niteworks are not someone I'd heard before, and the genre it lives in is not something that I've ever really come across before. The weaving together traditional Celtic and electronic sounds creates a unique and compelling soundscape. 

I enjoyed this more than I expected to. Air Fàir an Là is an album that for me made really good background listening while working. I generally like instrumental stuff for that, and lyrics in a language I don't understand might as well be instrumental.

I'll definitely be giving some more of Nitework's back catalogue a go.
