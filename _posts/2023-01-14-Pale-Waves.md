I'm not too familiar with Pale Waves, but I do like a few of the bands that have released music on the Dirty Hit record label, so I had high hopes for this one. 

Immediately the opening track Lies it's hard. Great pop punk-y vibe. It's all a bit reminicent of the kind of pop punk I used to listen to a decade ago, and I don't hate it. 

The whole of the first listen through it felt familar. To the point I was convinced I'd heard some of these songs 10 years ago. 

Highlight track for me is the opener Lies which really sets the tone for the rest of the album.

This is really in my wheel house and I'll be giving more Pale Waves music a go for sure.
