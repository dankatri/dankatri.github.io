This is first album of the year that I feel a bit let down by. 

Soccer Mommy are to my ears, very "Wet Leg", but they don't do it quite as well. 
The vocals are really muddy and I found it tough to make out what they're singing. From start to finish _Sometimes, Forever_ feels like it only has one mood, and I was waiting for it to really pick up and grab me. Unfortunately it didn't quite do that.
