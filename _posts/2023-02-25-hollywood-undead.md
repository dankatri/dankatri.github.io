## Hollywood Undead - Five

This is immediately familiar. It reminds me of being 16 and wearing all black, chains on my jeans and going to gigs every weekend. 

I thik though although I still wear a lot of black, I'm not as into this flavour of music as I used to be.

There are some fun songs, but none of them stood out as being more than rehashing what Avenged Sevenfold did 10 years ago.
