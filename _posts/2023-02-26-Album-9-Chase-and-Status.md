## Chase and Status - No More Idols

![Chase & Status](/images/Albums-2023/chase-status.jpg)

Chase and Status' first album - _More Than Alot_ - is one of the albums that I listened to endlessly when I was younger. It was right at the rise of dubstep and I couldn't get enough of it.

No More Idols isn't an album that I've listened to anywhere near as much, but I'm looking forward to giving it a spin. Especially after the let down [last week](/2023-02-25-hollywood-undead).
