## Chase and Status - No More Idols 

This album transported me back to university. Half of the album were regular features on the playlist at the one club in Lancaster. 

The album is full of features from some of the best names in the scene. Maybe they're not the best anymore, but they were at the time.

All of this is the kind of music that is best suited listened to in a club. It's loud, it's bassy and it's full of energy. 

★★★★☆
