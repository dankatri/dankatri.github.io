## Kendrick Lamar - Good Kid, M.A.A.D City

![Kendrick Lamar](/images/Albums-2023/kendrick-good-kid.jpg)

 I've listened to Kendrick before and I even listened to the two seasons of the [Dissect podcast](https://dissectpodcast.com/) about To Pimp a Butterfly, and DAMN. But I've not listened to this whole album before.
