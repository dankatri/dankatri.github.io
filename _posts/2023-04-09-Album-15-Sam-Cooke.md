## Sam Cooke - Ain't That Good News

![Sam Cooke](/images/Albums-2023/sam-cooke.jpg)


This is the oldest album on the list of 52. It was released in 1964.

Can't say that Sam Cooke is someone I'd really heard of previously. It should be interesting and a change of pace from the more modern stuff on [the list of 52](/Albums-2023).
