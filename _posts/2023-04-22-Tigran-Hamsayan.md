## Tigran Hamasyan - The Call Within


This is a wild ride. Not my usual listening but it's filled with energy, and musicality. 

I think to really appreciate this album you need to understan how musically complex it is, and how hard to play a lot of the parts are.

I enjoyed it as music to have on while I worked. The lack of lyrics helps me zone in a bit and the high energy got me going at a good pace. I'll be adding this to my rotation for sure. 

★★★★☆
