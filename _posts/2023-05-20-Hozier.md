## Hozier - Wasteland Baby!

The first thing that I noticed about this album was how soulful it is. Hozier's voice is incredible, and the music is so full of emotion. It's not easy to put a genre label on this either, it's a bit rock, a bit soul, and quite poppy.

I also expected to recognise some of the songs on the album, but none of them were familiar at all. I don't think this is his most popular album.

From this I definitely will be giving some of his other albums a blast.
