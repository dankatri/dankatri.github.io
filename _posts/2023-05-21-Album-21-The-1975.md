## The 1975 - The 1975
![The 1975](/images/Albums-2023/the1975.jpg)

The most hyped band of 2023. I actually saw them perform part of this album on a beach in Newquay about 10 years ago. I remember thinking they were pretty good but I didn't really get into them at the time. I'm interested to see how this sounds 10 years later.
