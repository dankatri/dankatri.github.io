## Turnstile - Glow On
![Glow On](/images/Albums-2023/turnstile-glow.jpg)

The only band to appear twice on my list of 52.

I'm hoping the more recent release will be a better listen than [Step To Rhythm](/_posts/2023-03-25-Turnstile-Step.md), which I wasn't a big fan of.

There's even a song with Blood Orange, colour me intrigued.
