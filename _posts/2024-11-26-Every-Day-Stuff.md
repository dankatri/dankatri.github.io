I'm fascinated by Everyday Carry (EDC), but my setup is unique. As someone working from home, most of my essential items aren't about portability—they're about daily functionality and comfort.

These are some of the things that I use almost every day. 
#### [SoundCore A20 Sleep Buds](https://amzn.to/4fGQNHB)

These are my latest must-have item. For years, I used AirPods and AirPods Pro for nighttime listening, but they were never comfortable for side-sleepers. Each morning, I'd quietly search for lost earbuds without waking my girlfriend.

The SoundCore A20 Sleep Buds solve those problems. They stay in place, are comfortable, and I'd immediately replace them if lost. 

#### [ZSA Voyager Keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/voyager)

As a professional who types all day, my keyboard matters. My previous Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard was comfortable but unreliable—I owned two, and both would randomly stop working.

The Voyager is different. Its split design allows a more natural typing position, and I can't imagine returning to a standard keyboard. The programmable shortcuts have become second nature, enhancing my workflow.
#### [Apple Watch Ultra](https://amzn.to/4fJssks)

I've worn an Apple Watch for nearly a decade. The Ultra model was chosen specifically for its battery life, and after two years, I still get over a day's use.

My focus is shifting from notifications to fitness tracking. It remains the best fitness tracker I've used, and I expect to keep it for at least another year. My only complaint is its casual look—it feels out of place at formal events like weddings.
#### [AirPods Pro 2](https://amzn.to/416QlOw)

Despite the Sleep Buds, these remain my primary earbuds. I'll admit they're in my ears for a significant part of the day.

#### [Anker MagGo USB-C SD card reader](https://amzn.to/4i8DCAX)

After buying a camera, drone, and video camera this year, I discovered how challenging file transfers can be. Device apps are often unreliable and slow.

The MagGo is a game-changer. It connects via USB-C, attaches magnetically to my phone, and is compact enough to carry everywhere. As a bonus, with a USB-C iPhone, I can shoot 4K video directly to the SD card.

#### [Yeti Rambler 18 Oz](https://amzn.to/4fJssks)

I've only really carried a water bottle with me in the last year or so. It's not as common here in the UK as it is in the US for people to always be carrying one. The Yeti does the job well, keeps water cold for a long time, and is super durable.
