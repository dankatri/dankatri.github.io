With an upcoming 17-day trip to Japan, I've been trying to nail down the perfect bag strategy. Between my partner and me, we're only checking a single suitcase (which I assume will be mostly claimed by her stuff). I generally prefer avoiding checked bags when possible.

I have a few backpacks in similar size ranges, so I figured a head-to-head comparison would help me make the best choice. Since I'm planning to do laundry at least once during the trip, I can travel relatively light.

## The Packing List

### Clothes

- **Underwear**: 6 pairs (mix of Fabletics and Under Armour boxers)
- **Socks**: 4 pairs (mix of Darn Tough and Uniqlo)
- **Shirts**: 5 t-shirts, 1 short sleeve shirt, 1 long sleeve shirt
- **Bottoms**: 1 pair of shorts, 1 pair of Western Rise Evolution trousers
- **Footwear**: 1 pair Xero sandals

The underwear and socks get packed into a Tom Bihn laundry stuff sack — one of my all-time favorite packing accessories. The rest of the clothes go into a Peak Design medium packing cube. Quick note on the Western Rise pants: I finally picked some up last year and they've been fantastic. Comfortable, packable, and versatile enough to dress up when needed.

### Tech

- **MacBook Pro 14**: A necessity since this is partly a work trip (would skip for pure vacation)
- **Kindle Paperwhite**: My new obsession this year
- **Evergoods CAP1**: Houses all the cables and adapters
- **DJI Osmo Pocket 3**: A fun little video camera I want to use more
- **FujiFilm X100F**: Having a dedicated camera keeps me more present than constantly using my phone
- **Audio**: AirPods Pro 2 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra (the Bose primarily for the long flight)
- **Power**: Otterbox Apple Watch battery and Anker Zolo power bank (love the built-in cable)

For toiletries, I use the Peak Design small wash pouch — probably bigger than I need, but it nestles perfectly between packing cubes.

Not everything will fit comfortably in the main backpack, but I'll also be carrying the Peak Design Outdoor Sling (7L) for flight essentials and quick-access items:

- Kindle
- DJI Osmo Pocket 3
- FujiFilm X100F
- Bellroy wallet
- Alpaka Passport wallet
- AirPods
- Bose headphones

## The Contenders

### Tom Bihn Synik 30

The Synik easily swallows everything I threw at it. The clamshell-style main compartment offers tremendous capacity, though it lacks structure and flops around when fully open. When fully loaded, it does steal some capacity from the external pockets, making the water bottle pocket particularly challenging to use.

There's still a bit of extra room — I could probably squeeze in another t-shirt if needed. One major plus is the separate laptop access without opening the main compartment. The Synik features numerous external pockets, which is convenient but potentially problematic in pickpocket-heavy areas.

The straps are exceptionally comfortable, and even when fully loaded, I feel like I could carry this for hours without complaint. The back panel is a basic mesh — not fancy, but perfectly adequate in moderate temperatures.

### Peak Design Travel Backpack 30L

I packed this without expanding it to its full 30L capacity, so it should be around 27L in this configuration.

Unlike the somewhat floppy Synik, this is essentially a structured box with backpack straps. It has a clean, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. I was surprised by how efficiently the main compartment accommodated my packing cubes, though the interior zippered compartments seem pointless since they're inaccessible without emptying the bag.

The single external zip pocket is decently sized and fit my CAP1 pouch. One quirk: you access the main compartment through the back panel, with the laptop sleeve in the lid. I worry I might forget this and accidentally crack my laptop by opening the bag too aggressively.

When packed full, the external bottle pockets become nearly useless — my Yeti had no chance of fitting. The straps are better than reviews led me to believe. While I wouldn't go hiking with this bag, it's comfortable enough for airport terminals and train station-to-hotel walks. Despite being the heaviest of my options, it doesn't feel that way. The included lash straps are a nice touch for attaching a jacket to the exterior.

### Evergoods CTB26 (Griffin Edition)

This matches the PD's volume and likewise had no trouble accommodating my packing cubes. It offers better external access with the signature Evergoods yoke pocket (one of my favorite features) and a quick-access top pocket — both remain usable even when the bag is packed full.

The waxed canvas version might be the most aesthetically pleasing bag of the bunch, but it comes with drawbacks. It's heavy (about 1.5kg empty) and lacks the excellent back panel found on other Evergoods bags. This makes it a poor choice for warm climates or situations requiring extended wear.

Surprisingly, despite being packed to capacity, the side water bottle pockets still accommodated my Yeti. My biggest complaint is the lack of a hip belt option. The bag sits high on the back and gets heavy quickly, so including the hip belt from its bigger sibling (the CTB35) would have been welcome.

### Bonus: Evergoods CTB26 (Phoenix Edition)

The Phoenix version of the CTB26 performed identically to the Griffin in terms of capacity, but it's lighter and features that excellent Evergoods back panel. For this particular trip, the Phoenix is likely the more practical choice, even if it doesn't look quite as cool.

## The Verdict

For a few reasons — primarily comfort and versatility — I'm leaning toward taking the Synik. While both the Peak Design and Evergoods bags offer more structure (maintaining their shape even when empty), the Synik can "shrink" when not fully packed, making it more suitable as a day bag during the trip.

My biggest gripe with the Synik is its limited handle options. When flying or taking trains, I'll need to stow my backpack overhead or on luggage racks. Both the Evergoods and Peak Design bags feature handles on multiple sides for easy grabbing and carrying. The Synik has only a top handle, which works but isn't ideal — side handles would be a welcome addition.
