I really, really enjoyed this. It's a depature from almost anything that I would normally listen to. 

The sound of a sousaphone is unmistakeable. I was immedately reminded of Hot 8 Brass Band, which probably tells you that my knowledge of this genre is as shallow as a shower.

This is music that makes you want to move, with politically charged lyrics. 
The track names remind you of the politicism. They're all named after notable black women through history. Some I had never heard of but all of whom I've since googled.

hightlight track: My Queen is Anna Julia Cooper
