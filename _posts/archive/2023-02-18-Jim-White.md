This is the kind of music I want to listen to live in a dingy, smoky bar somewhere in the southern states. 

It's raw, raspy and has a real bluesy feel to it. There's some interesticial pieces of audio that talk about life in the south and what music means.

I'll definitely be looking out for the documentary.
