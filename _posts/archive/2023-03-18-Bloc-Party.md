## Bloc Party - Silent Alarm

I was most shocked by how old this album is. It's 18 years old. That makes no sense to me at all. It doesn't feel like almost 20 years since I was sneaking into indie club nights in Birmingham.

18 years on it holds up. This is an album I know so well that it's hard to listen to it subjectively.
