## Turnstile - Step 2 Rhythm


This isn't really an album, more and EP as it's not even 20 minutes long. 

For me it's a bit too unstructured. I didn't find any of the songs catchy and I didn't really find any of them memorable.

Turnstile are the only artist with more than one albuum on my list of 52 albums, and I'm hoping that I enhjoy the other one more.
