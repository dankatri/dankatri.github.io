## Natasha Bedingfield - Unwritten

Another album from my childhood that is almost 20 years old. The singles from this album are burnt into my brain, and I bet they likely are for pretty much everyone who was alive in the early 2000s. 

_These Words_ is still a top notch pop song. It's impossible not to bop along.

I also wasn't expecting to remember all of the songs, but quite a few were familiar. I definitely didn't remember that there was a song featuring Bizarre from D12. You can't miss it on a listen through - he announces himself as "Bizarre from D12" at the start of the song.

Can't help but love it to be honest. When I was younger I think I would have loved to put this kind of album down, but now I can appreciate it for what it is, great pop music.
