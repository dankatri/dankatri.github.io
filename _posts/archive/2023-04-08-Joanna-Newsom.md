## Joanna Newsom - Have One on Me



Interestingly the only album so far that isn't on Spotify. Luckily it is on Apple Music.

I really enjoyed this, it reminded me a lot of Regina Spektor. It's a bit quirky, but in a good way. I really enjoyed the lyrics, and the music was great. I'm not sure it'll make my regular rotation, but I'm glad I listened.

★★★★☆
