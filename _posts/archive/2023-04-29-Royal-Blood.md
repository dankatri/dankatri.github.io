## Royal Blood - Royal Blood

I love this album. The heavyness that they somehow manage despite being a two piece is incredible. 

The riffs are catchy. I think when the album came out it got a bit overplayed and as a result I didn't give the whole thing a chance but it really is great.

The opening of Out of the Black really reminded me of the start of a song by a small band called [HAUNTS](https://open.spotify.com/track/72epY1AvMKg7LOwAouq9Hp?si=c1c145b33511440e) that haven't existed for a long time. I'm not sure if it's a direct influence or just a coincidence but it was a nice surprise.
