## Trivium - Ascendancy

I'm immediately transported back to being 14 years old. 

While this did come out in 2005, it could have easily been earlier. It's a very early 2000s metal album.

It still holds up though. I do think that some styles of music don't age as badly and metal, for me at least, is one of those styles.

It's got it all, gang vocals, discordant beatdowns, harmonised guitar solos. I don't know what more you need. 

*Pull Harder on the Strings of Your Martyr* is a ridiculouly metal song title but it holds up and still is an awesome listen.
