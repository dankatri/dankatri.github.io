## The 1975 - The 1975

Matty Healy - frontman for The 1975, is a nepo-baby who owes a lot of his success to his parents both being famous. 

This album is honestly a let down. I see how huge they are now with world wide arena tours happening, but this first album is so forgettable. Other than the big singles that were huge when they came out at the time I don't think there's a song on this album I could hum the tune to.

★★☆☆☆
