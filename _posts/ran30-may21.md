I think the biggest lesson learned is that this wasn't actually quite as mad as I expected it would be. 

The first 10km I tried to make myself take it easy, but accidentally ran a 10km PB.

Having people to run with was essential - especially for the later runs. I ran the first 10km alone but for the rest I had people out there with me. I can say that without this help I wouldn't have finished the running on the day. The last 10km in particular really, really took it out of me. Both physically and emotionally.

As I got to the last 5k of the day I began to feel a little delirious almost. I was struggling to find the words I was looking for, and I basically felt drunk. If my friend Ria had not been running with me I would have given up. It was also barely something I could call running by the end. 

Putting myself through the day was a decision I made pretty lightly. Along the way I learnt a bit about myself, and best of all managed to raise a good amount of money for a great cause. 

I won't be doing anything quite like this for the foreseeable future.
