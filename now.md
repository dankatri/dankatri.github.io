# Now

## January 2023

### Culture 

* **Reading 📕** 
   * [Humankind](https://amzn.to/3J7yDBt) - A hopeful history is what this book bills itself as, and it is nice considering the times we live in, to hear that maybe humanity isn't completely awful afterall. 
   * [Yearbook](https://amzn.to/3H0fLlc) - Seth Rogan's memoirs is I guess how I'd describe this. It's funny and there's some insight into what goes into making the funny stuff that Rogan has made over the years. I listened to the audiobook, and I think it's the best way to enjoy the book, the perfomance adds a lot. 

* **Listening to 🎧**
	* This year I'm making an effort to increase my music listening. You can check in on the progress of this as I work my way through a different album each week in my [52 Albums project](/Albums-2023/).
   

### Life
   * Big change for me at the end of January this year. I'm leaving my current job after just over 3 years, to start a new one at GitHub. I'm incredibly excited to get going!

## May 2021

### Culture 

* **Reading 📕** 
   * [Greenlights by Matthew McConauhey](https://amzn.to/3hz3Tve) - I'm listening to the audio book of this and I would 100% reccomend it. McConauhey's voice is silky smooth and his delivery is unmatched.  

* **Listening to 🎧**
	* [Launched](https://launchedfm.com) - I enjoy Charlie's interview of various iOS devs or people in the related ecosystem have been really interesting and have me wanting to spend more time looking into Swift.
	* [Daði Freyr's Welcome EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/2kyjJ29FqLjMt4dnSEDvbn?si=-TI5TN_wQkuFVhGOuhRnHA) - Think About Things was my favourite song of last year, it's just pure pop. The EP is more of the same great pop, and 10 Years is another banger.
   
* **Watching 📺**
   * Taskmaster is still the best thing on British TV - the current line up is one of the best yet.
   * [Mosquito Coast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11041132/) - one of AppleTV's lastest shows. Written by Louis Theroux's dad and starring his cousin. It's about a family on the run and it's a wild ride so far.

### Life
   * Turning 30 last month was a big deal, so was running 30km on the day. I wrote about that [here](https://dkatri.xyz/blog/ran30-may21/)

## April 2021

### Culture 
* **Reading 📕** 
   * [The 99% Invisible City by Roman Mars & Kurt Kohlstedt](https://amzn.to/3sTZrtQ) - For years [99% Invisible](https://99pi.org) has been a favourite podcast of mine. This book is for the kind of nerd that loves the podcast. It's all about things that are right in front of us but are easily missed. 

* **Listening to 🎧**
   * [All Consuming](https://allconsuming.show) - You know those weird products that you see advertised on Instagram? Things like [high protein cereal](https://magicspoon.com/) or [camera that you can stick in your ear to look at wax](https://axelglade.com)? Adam Lisagor of [Sandwich Video](https://sandwich.co) fame, and Noah Kalina, who I will always think of as [the timelapse guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAIZ36GI4p8) take a look at some of these products and give them a thorough review. 

   * [Sappenin' with Sean Smith](https://instagram.com/sappeninpod) - Sean Smith was the front man of one of the most fun bands to come out of the South Wales music scene in the early 2000s - The Blackout. Sappenin' has him interviewing some of the most interesting people in the rock/emo/punk scene. I am firmly an emo kid at heart and this kicks up a lot of nostalgia. 

* **Watching 📺**
   * Line of Duty is better than I had expected. In the last month we've binged through the first 4 seasons in a few weeks.

### Life
   * I turn 30 later this month and that is quite honestly terrifying. I've been concentrating on running lots in preparation for my big challenge at the end of the month, and as a result have not actually stopped to think about how weird turning 30 feels. 

## March 2021

### Culture 
* **Reading 📕** 
    * [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://amzn.to/3sGSpbZ) - A nice look at how habits are formed and how you can design bits of life to enforce goo behaviour and discourage bad. I think I've made more notes on this book than any others I've read in a while. 
* **Listening to 🎧**
    * [Macrodosing with Arian Foster and PFT Commenter.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0qRbXeOUYT7J9dgzryXl0A) - I've always been facinated by conspiracies, and this show is a couple funny people delving into conspiracies.  
    * [Modern Finance with Kevin Rose](https://mofi.net) - Kevin Rose has been someone that I've followed online for a long, long time. His latest podcast has him talking about the changing face of finance. The first episode delves into NFTs which is a whole other rabbit hole.
### Life
* Running has been a doninant thing over the last month. Over 100km run in March - which is the most I've ever covered in a single month. April is gonna be tough with my 30KM challenge day at the end.


## Feburary 2021

### Culture
* **Reading 📕** 
    - [Inglorious Empire by Sashi Tharoor](https://amzn.to/2NIn2y8). It's incredible how damaging Britain's colonisation of India was. Being half Indian myself, I am ashamed to say I never realised quite how bad it was, and obviously this isn't taught in British schools.
    - [Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker](https://amzn.to/2M1OaHI). Sleep is important but I don't think that we're really aware of how precious that it is. This has me re-thining how much I sleep - but also I'm getting old so it could be that as well.
* **Listening to 🎧** 
    - The Tim Ferris show is one where I pick and choose episodes rather than listen to every one religiously. I finally listened to his [episode with Jamie Foxx](https://tim.blog/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/) and it was great from beginning to end. Jamie Foxx is so damn talented and has some great stories. It's an old episode but still great.
    - [Upgrade](https://relay.fm/upgrade) from Relay FM is still one of the best Apple focused tech shows out there and one that jumps to the top of my queue every time.

### Life 
* Lockdown is getting old. I haven't been to the pub since November 3rd. 
* I've been managing to stay consistent with running. I'm _slowly_ getting fitter. I ran 5k non-stop for the first time in a while. Not the biggest milestone, but trending in the right direction. 
* Starting to do more DIY projects at home is fun, but I am constantly worried that I am going to damage something beyond repair.


## January 2021 

### Culture
* **Reading 📕**
    - [Food of The Gods by Terrance McKenna](https://amzn.to/2Zw23ku) - I enjoy reading about psychadelics and McKenna provides an interesting history of them and how core they've been to human culture for a long time.
* **Listening to 🎧**   
    - so many podcasts but the stand out for me at the moment is [Dissect's deep analysis of Childish Gambino's Because The Internet](https://dissectpodcast.com/2020/09/07/season-7-because-the-internet/). All of the Dissect podcasts are real good
* **Watching 📺**
    - I realised that I hadn't seen Inglorious Basterds in maybe a decade. I righted that wrong. Still a great film.
    - Ted Lasso on Apple TV+ is so much better than I expected it to be. 


### Life
* Enjoying life in a new home, there is a _ton_ of work to do. But I'm excited by that.
* I have decided that as I can't do anything fun for my 30th this year, I'm going to spend the day running. 30km in a day, whilst raising money for charity. It should be... interesting. - If you'd like you can [donate!](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/dk30km)
